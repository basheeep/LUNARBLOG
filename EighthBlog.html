  <p >The sex drive of a rabbit and an attitude of a brawler, the boy with an large anatomy in between his thighs yet isn’t really a solid person on the inside.

I’m the girl who has two brothers. Brothers that fuck girls in the daylight and smoke weed on the night time. Brothers who play girls for a living and has fake friends for the mending. Brothers who learned to run before they walked. Brothers who drink JD on a regular night and drinks beer on the fancy nights.

Girls, it’s all about the little details.

This is why I don’t trust the boy that talks great, smiles great, drinks great, fucks great, wears great and is literally all things great.

Ever heard of something called “fake syndrome”? Probably not, because I created it.

Well this syndrome isn’t the mediocre kind. 

It’s fucking dope because almost every time someone comes close enough I read through the symptoms and realize that this bitch was going to get played if it wasn’t for the ‘fake syndrome analysis’.

Let me enlighten you.

What makes you worth it? Is it because you fucking care when most of them don’t?  Well shit. It doesn’t work like that boo. Reverse psychology. If you want them to give you their time of day, show them that you could literally fucking not give a shit. Magic can happen, the guy who you considered a friend all this time will ask you where you live for a change and there you have it, all this time he’s been faking it, the whole friend’s thing. 

If a guy kisses your ass or well goes as far as to lick your ass, he probably wants to fuck you not take you out on a romantic date.

If a guy drinks cheap shit in front of you or even drinks some expensive shit, he’s probably checking for your attitude towards his wealth. Sigh, those gold diggers are a disgrace. Disappointed.

He wants to take you out, pamper you up with his good looks and smart mouth and couple of weeks later you are in his bed, naked. Well there you go… do I even have to?

‘Fake syndrome’ is presented to you in the small things that we don’t really read much into.

Thank god for having brothers for me to learn this crap.

It’s always sad to know that you weren’t really important to people who you considered very much valued in your life. 

People fucking suck.

If it helps though fake syndrome isn’t infectious.
Laters, babe.

Hold tight to that bottle of white rum, you’ll need it.
XOXO</p>
