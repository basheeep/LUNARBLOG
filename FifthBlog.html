  <p >Fucking hell.

I was hooked from the start. And honestly I knew what it would lead to. I knew that by the slightest touch I’d be addicted and by just one word he said I would fall in love.

Fall in love with his shadow, his darkness, his pain, his intensity and that I would fall in love with his burning passion.
He was what I called toxic because of his beautiful soul that would only leave me bare. And yet to know all of this I only had to look into his eyes. The warmth and the care it held left me weak on my knees. Fucking hell I was gone.
The moment of error. The point of weakness. The point of earth shattering and life altering moments were left out in the open.

He has more than four tattoos on his body and tattoos were something that I hold attraction to. Not just because of its art but because of its meaning. I wanted to run the tip of my index finger along his smooth skin, wanted to ask him of the stories that were hidden behind each black work of art.

He’s the type of man that would make you laugh whilst pouring kisses down your neck, making sure to show the passion he had towards you right in that intimate moment.
He’s the type of man that would fuck you against the kitchen counter top while the early morning sun rays fell out of lace covered curtain windows. He’s the type of man that would whisper sweet nothings against your ears while he made sweet sweet love to you. He would hold out doors and kiss you on your cheek. He’d annoy you just to make you mad.

But he looks like he went through a hurricane before he fell into my life. Like he barely survived, like he was surprised that he was breathing when he was sure that he ran out of breath a long time back. He would never show it though, instead he’d smile to make everyone believe and show warmth in his beautiful eyes. I almost believed and fell for his façade but then I realized he was just like me.

God. Fuck he’s so unique and so good in all the right ways.
He’d love to the point of fire and I’m scared that I’ll get burnt. Because really, burns hurt like a bitch.

If I could just run back and hide but oh, he’d still find me. In the middle of all hell breaking lose he’d still find me. Because he’s the kind of man that would go all in for love.</p>
