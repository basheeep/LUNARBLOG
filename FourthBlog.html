  <p >A Lankan girl with an addictive habit of smoking weed and what not, cue the stink eye of walking passers, especially those with saggy tits and yellow teeth and of course wolf whistling of a boy who has never seen a pussy in their time of day or a girl with a cigarette in-between her lips. Ha the life of a party.

The struggle is real my friends, I love my country and I love my culture but what I do not agree with is how the people in this country seem to be stuck in a century that has long gone.

We all break promises that we make at the age of twelve and mine was of that never ever putting a cigarette in my lips but then life happened which comes with depression, stress and heartbreak. One thing leads to another and I was with my friend in the back staircase of my college smoking and talking about how shitty life is.

I am pretty sure that all girls go through with the trouble of society judging you for being what you are, be it because you are a smoker or for that short skirt you wore that made your ass look great.

So this is where I come up with the idea of gathering all girl power to send out a big FUCK YOU to all those saggy titted (is that a word?  Who cares?) women and for all those local boys who are yet to have an orgasm.

If you chose to sit on a guys face for the rest of your life, if you want the D just as much as the D wants the V then no one has the right to call you a whore, a slut or whatever the fuckers come up with these day’s and FYI double standards are way overrated. If you decide that you want to look hot for yourself and not for some horny fucker then go ahead and wear the tightest and the shortest leather skirt that you can find in your closet and while you are at it lose the panties, no one should stop wearing what they want to wear just because others don’t want you to. If you want to smoke some hash and while you are rolling your joint people stare, don’t stop what you are doing instead ask them if they want some, being kind is always good isn’t it? If you want to become a pilot and all those grannies keep nagging you with their ‘only boys can become pilots and girls should wash dishes and make paripu (dhal)’ for the rest of your life bullshit, well get those license and shove it in their wrinkly faces, serves them right.

The reality is that even if you cover yourself like a nun, suck dick only after you are married, if you’ve never smoked and decides to make paripu for the rest of your life people will still have something to say and point at nonexistent imperfections. This is why I do whatever the fuck I want even when I am being judged.

But sending out the message will help for starters.

So stop pretending to be plain Jane and embrace that wildness in you and screw as many guys as you want, wear the most revealing shirt you own and smoke whatever the hell you want and show the middle finger at those cunts who don’t have the backbone to do it themselves but instead they criticize at those who do.

      May you smoke more weed, suck more dick and live the life to your fullest. Peace out. – Shanki.</p>
