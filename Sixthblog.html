  <p >The truth is that sometimes people fall out of love and some of us are scared of commitments, we are easily attracted to others and staying loyal becomes harder with a environment surrounded by temptations.

But I do believe that one of these days we are going to find somebody that is worth staying loyal to, somebody whose worthy enough to ignore all temptations for and if you already don’t feel like dedicating your whole life or your forever to a person, that just means that you haven’t found that one person whose worth it, yet. 

But if whatever you feel and whatever you want is so flare-up that you have to cheat on someone is not something anyone should be proud of or something that you should do.

I’ve been cheated on once, it made me feel useless. Knowing that the one person you give your body and soul is the one who cheated on you sucks like nothing. It left me so insecure about myself and trusting people got very hard.

Getting into a relationship is a huge responsibility, you will be responsible for each others happiness and sadness at times. Being in a relationship means that whatever happens you will face it with each other, you will win battles and face wars together. Being in a relationship means being loyal and honest. It means understanding and empathising. It sometimes mean being the bigger person and saying sorry first. A relationship is something that will change your life if its taken seriously. So to cheat at the end of it all is like a stab in the back letting you know that you aren’t what they want.

I ask myself why people cheat? And the only reason that I could think of were that either he or she warned the partner that they didn’t have feelings for the other and the other person must have asked to work things through, what the other person did wrong was trying to work things through. I mean yes, sometimes working through helps but rarely. Asking someone to work things through usually is like putting them into a hole and not letting them out, which leads to the only easy method of escape ‘cheating’. It could be that they aren’t satisfied with what they have and many more other reasons.

Cheating shouldn’t be an option, at all. 

Usually talking works.

I guess people who cheat has their own reasons for their actions but its those actions that leads to major consequences.

Honestly if someone cheats on you, you shouldn’t waste a tear on them because each and everyone of us deserves a little respect.

For all those who got cheated on, trust me you are better off without them.

And for all those who cheats, well I guess you should be happy now.</p>
