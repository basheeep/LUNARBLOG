  <p >I don’t want the world to see me as a girl who smokes up and talks about many things sexual. No, I’d rather the world see me as someone doing her own thing and creating awareness among others that its totally fucking fine if you do something that others consider inacceptable in this society, point fucking blank.
And in my haste to start a blog, I never once actually pegged on the consequences that would occur out of getting awareness. For real.
To be honest, since I am always honest. I have felt the need to stop writing because during the period of time where my blog received so much attention. I got as equivalent amount of bad reviews as to good. And I never started the blog with the need of others reading it or with the need of opinions but I do welcome them as I see most of them as motivation or a way of rectifying my mistakes.
That was the main reason for my inactiveness, this basically created a writer’s block for me. In order to present my blog with the same content but with a new light, I decided to change my blog name and delete many posts that received so much feedback. It was done out of spite but something I regretted proceeding that action.
This is me being honest. Like I always have been.
So, with this brief explanation for my absence and the name change in my blog, I’d like you to know that publicly admitting to living a life in the most of honest ways is sometimes considered a crime by most who show and live in a very unrealistic way. In other words, show casing a life accepted by society yet that world being nonexistent in reality.
This is fine by me because really you are only lying to yourself. What myself and I am pretty sure most of the others would agree on however would be finding a problem in that kind of people feeling threatened by us because we live by the truth.
People who talk about you behind your back feels threatened by you, out of spite or because of irredeemable jealousy. So, this is me laying it out up front.
Quite contrary to what they believe we actually have better things to do rather than get back at them for that kind of immature shit.
Ugh that helped me, typing out my inner frustrations that is.
Alright that’s all.
Stay tuned for a good and much sexual read.
