  <p >And kid, it’s hard to breathe sometimes specially when everyone seems to be pointing the finger at you but none of them know your side of the story. It’s hard to live in a world where we think we trust the right people but we don’t and in that moment where everything goes wrong when you have done nothing wrong you are entitled to feel hopeless and lonesome, dreams seem so far away out of your reach, laughter seems like something out of a fairytale, best friends feel like an ancient history character from a book in 1785, love seem like a myth that can only come true to all those who are worthy of it and there is nothing and no one there to give a pat to your back and let you know that everything is going to be fine at the end and that with time everything will fall into place. And even if someone did pat you in the back that anger that holds in your heart will lead you to shout out to the world that they don’t know how you feel, that they don’t know what it’s like to be at the edge of the bridge with nothing left to hold on to. You fight so hard to show them that you are honest, that you are what you said to be, that you would give what is left of you to someone if that’s what will make them happy, you try to make people who are sad, smile when you are sad yourself but they don’t see, you help and help, you listen and listen, you show them that you’re there for them but one’s you need someone there is no one left because they judge you afterwards and one wrong word and they tick and tick until they are against you. All those times you’ve been there does not matter. Worst of it all kid is when they show you that they are honest but you get that heart clenching feeling that they are lying but you still hold on because you have nothing left and when that cracks you are left with this cloud of darkness thats waiting to take over your heart but you build your walls and you become this robotic creature that does nothing but exist in the world but doesn’t know how to live. People are not who they tell they are, you are no one to them. You are nothing. You are pathetic. You are stupid. You are not them. Be still my heart,  you are about to fall and what little energy that you did have in you is gone and you fall. Fall because there is no one to catch you, fall because you feel pathetic for letting them in, you fall because you have to smile it till you make it, fall because you feel empty, fall because you feel like a failure but it all changes, it all changes kid, every little thing changes when you realise that they have no power on you unless you give them the power to destroy you, you don’t have to fake a smile because honestly you are better off without them, you don’t have to believe that you are pathetic because you aren’t, it’s them, it is them who are pathetic, it is them who are worthless, it is them that is a failure all you have been doing is care, love and being loyal, in no book does it say that you are the villain in all the books and the movies it is you who is the hero because you survived, you have survived through worse and this, this is nothing. So kid, you need to be trampled, broken and at the lowest point in your life to realise that nothing matters, not the fact they betrayed you, not the fact that they show you this facade because at the end nothing ever lasts. Nothing lasts and time is limited, I’d rather spend what is left of my time on things that will make me grow into a beautiful lady that can tell one day of all I’ve gone through to get somewhere. Don’t waste time on trash that is meant to be on the garbage and not next to you.</p>
