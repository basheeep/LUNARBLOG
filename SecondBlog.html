  <p >It was that phase where the mandatory tinder account is required in your tedious life. We all go through it and in my opinion, it’s a great place to meet people and even greater place for a booty call.
Tinder is where I met a lot of people with quite the extraordinary personalities, it was fun and tinder is the reason I met Uwin Lugoda. Tinder, holds many of my firsts.
I found him hot and from the first glance he looked as interesting as I thought he would be. We started up a conversation and it lead to swapping numbers.
Once upon a time I would have been nervous to meet anyone from online but I realized I thrive on danger in a daily basis. We first met at Burger King, Mount Lavinia. I was heading to a party that night and my brother was tagging along, it was a spontaneous decision to meet that day but I am very glad we did so.
He told me his story and I was hooked, and he was expressing his thoughts on my blog, it was much appreciated coming from him. We kept the conversation flowing and it was never boring.
I like reading people, and this might be news to him. He is an open-minded person with so much thoughts in his mind in regard of everything he found interesting, he spoke a great deal about the society in Sri Lanka and that was something I found we have in common. He is great in many ways but the greatest of them all I found is his passion for writing.
Uwin, is a travel blogger and a great one at that. His passion for it is prodigious. He has been on the road for a while and he has a great deal of expertise in travelling. As cliché as it may sound you could see how much he loves what he does in his eyes and in his manner of speaking in that subject.
‘Brothers elsewhere’, is the name of his blog. Currently, it’s under construction and his site is to be released in a few months and it has me on my toes. Uwin so far has travelled to many places, some of them being Loch Ness, Spain, Berlin, Nottingham, Washington, Grand Canyon and many other places.
He recently introduced his Instagram account for his blog and it has some great clicks on few of the places he has travelled to. To see what I am really talking about just follow him @brotherselsewhere on Instagram.
The great part about his escapades is that anyone and everyone can join him and I am one of those people waiting in line for his next trip in October. He loves meeting new people and experiencing different cultures. He’s having the time of his life and you can join him and he’s too kind to be a serial killer, that makes it even more better.
I have so much to say about Uwin and some of them words cannot really express. He’s a good guy whose great at what he’s doing and I’d recommend him to anyone who wants his expertise.
Even more, he’s a great friend and a great person, it makes what he does exciting for myself and I speak for all his friends and family as well.
To stay tuned for his site release I do recommend following him.
