  <p >There’s always that guy, who makes your life a living hell by being so good at saying what you want to hear and being what you want to be with. That one guy we fall for so easily and goes back to constantly no matter how much they hurt us and no matter how much of a dick head he is.</p>
  <p>He the real MVP. He could be fucking ugly as shit for all we care. He is so good, good enough to sweet talk your ass till you are dripping wet, just because his goal is to eat your ass out. That shit hurts girl! Knowing that you are bawling your eyes out for a motherfucker who doesn’t even give two shits about your heart, just your pussy.</p>
  <p>The thing is you know that with that guy you are going to end up with a broken heart and with a bucket of ice cream beside you, watching some sappy shit wishing it was him and you instead. That’s some sad shit right there but really, it’s the truth.</p>
  <p>I really don’t get how we could find someone so selfish and egotistical, super fucking attractive. How we could fall for someone, be reckless after guarding our hearts for ages. I mean I have been anti-feelings for a while now and this guy from years back, comes and start being a dick head and fucking BAM! There my heart goes skipping beats. Like what even?! All that hard work and sweat chasing bois away from your heart, gone away by a fucking second. So, yeah girl we have a fucking right to be pissed right now.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you about all the wet dreams that guy can give just by existing mere distance away. It’s fucking embarrassing, how many times I have had to wake up and shower to take off the heat between my thighs. I’m not joking fam, being super fucking real right now.<br>
  And that mouth, his voice works as a ringing tone in my head. He could say my name while being mad at me, I don’t care but just please keep saying my name with all the other shit spewing out of your mouth baby! Please!</p>
  <p>He can make you feel like a needy hoe, wanting his love and his affection, among other things. And you could be the furthest thing from a hoe. It doesn’t matter who you are or how much of a control you have over your heart, he can make you feel shit that other men can’t and that’s probably why we are down his throat demanding needy things from a man clearly in need of more fucking and less emotions to deal with.<br>
  And it is clear as day that men have commitment issues just like us, even more so considerably.</p>
  <p>The fact is that it could be the wrong time, wrong person and wrong everything but my heart is having a hard time getting that into its system and by time I’m talking years here. And the heart wants what it wants, that’s the harsh reality. And my heart clearly wants this player who plays with women’s emotions like it’s a fucking game of cards. He literally could play this game with one eye closed and he’d still be winning like he’s getting lucky tonight and by all means necessary he will. He will be eating out your pussy by a few hours and you will be screaming, just not stop. Been there, done that.</p>
  <p>Let me get real though, it hurts like a bitch. When he says it’s, you he wants but few seconds later you see his phone lighting up with a text from an Amanda asking what time ‘baby’ is coming to her place. And it hurts knowing that you love the same guy so fucking much that you would give anything for a day in his arms, listening to everything he says and to know that he would still be there the next morning to kiss you awake. Boy, does it hurt. Wanting things that you have never wanted with this guy who doesn’t give a shit about you.</p>
  <p>And that’s just it, he does not give a fucking shit.</p>
  <p>That’s just it, isn’t it.</p>
  <p>Sad but that’s the harsh reality.</p>
  <p>And the one I need.</p>
